# Exploratory_Data_Project
Project One Exploratory Analysis Project
Examples from Datacamp of creating dataframes from a big dataset. In this exercise, you'll compute measures of center to compare food consumption in the US and Belgium using your pandas and numpy skills. Dataset: food_consumption. It contains information about the kilograms of food consumed per person per year in each country in each food category (consumption) as well as information about the carbon footprint of that food category (co2_emissions) measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide, or CO2, per person per year in each country.

# Import numpy with alias np
import numpy as np

# Filter for Belgium
be_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'Belgium']

# Filter for USA
usa_consumption = food_consumption[food_consumption['country'] == 'USA']

# Calculate mean and median consumption in Belgium
print(np.mean(be_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(be_consumption['consumption']))

# Calculate mean and median consumption in USA
print(np.mean(usa_consumption['consumption']))
print(np.median(usa_consumption['consumption']))

# Subset for Belgium and USA only
be_and_usa = food_consumption[(food_consumption['country'] == "Belgium") | (food_consumption['country'] == 'USA')]

# Group by country, select consumption column, and compute mean and median
print(be_and_usa.groupby('country')['consumption'].agg([np.mean, np.median]))
